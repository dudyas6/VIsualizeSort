This is a small Java project i've made using Java Swing and some Sorting Algorithms studied at CS course.

Heres a preview to the Visualization prior to and post sorting:

While running u'll see all the sorting done by the second, so you can try running it yourself. 
To change current sorthing method, go to Visualizer.java and queue.add(new sortType), that is alrdy in algorithms folder.
